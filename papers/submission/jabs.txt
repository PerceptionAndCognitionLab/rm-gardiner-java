Perhaps the most evidential behavioral result for two memory processes comes from Gardiner and Java (1990).  Participants provided more remember than know responses for old words but more know than remember responses for old nonwords.  At the same time, there was no effect of word/nonword status for new items.  The combination of a crossover interaction for old items with an invariance for new items provides strong evidence for two distinct processes while ruling out criteria or bias explanations.  Here, we report a modern replication of this remarkable study.  In two experiments with larger numbers of items and participants, we were unable to replicate the stunning crossover, and more to the point, our data are more consistent with a single-process account.  Moreover, we were able to replicate Gardiner and Java's baseline, one-process-like results with sure and unsure response options.   It seems that Gardiner and Java's remarkable result is not replicable.
